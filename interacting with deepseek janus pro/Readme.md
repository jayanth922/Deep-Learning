In colab, i interacted with deepseek januspro multimodal through huggingface spaces. It has 2 endpoints.

1. For generating images based on prompt
2. Given an image, explaining the image in detail.

It performed both the tasks well and you can see its responses in the notebook. I have also attached the image it explained.
