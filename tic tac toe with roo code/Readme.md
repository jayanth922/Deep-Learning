I used roo code, an ai extension in vs code which uses different llm providers to help build apps. 

It also has different agents like 
code-where its main task is to generate proper code while maintaining the context,
architect-where it excels in explaining a projects high level architecture of how different components work together and 
ask-where it execels at reasoning on how the generated code works or helps explain errors etc. 


we can also build our own customized agents. 

I asked it to create a simple full stack application (game) and it initially came up with a number guessing game. When i asked it to generate a complex game, it came up with tic tac toe.

I also attached the chat history with it.
